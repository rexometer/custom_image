# Make a ready to use image
This is a simple method to provide ready to use plug&play base stations

It preconfigures the base station with inputs, feeds, a dashboard and the myelectric app.
Steps how to use:

Clone, make it executable and run it:
`git clone https://github.com/rexometer/custom_image.git && cd custom_image && sudo chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh`

>**Attention:** Only use this with new images! Otherwise it will overwrite your files and settings!
