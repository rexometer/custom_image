# Make a ready to use image
This is a simple method to provide ready to use plug&play base stations

It preconfigures the base station with inputs, feeds, a dashboard and the myelectric app.
Steps how to use:

1. `git clone https://github.com/rexometer/custom_image.git`
2. Make script executable: `cd custom_image` and then `sudo chmod +x run.sh`
3. Run: `./run.sh`

>**Attention:** Only use this with new images! Otherwise it will overwrite your files and settings!
